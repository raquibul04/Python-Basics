# Rock, Paper, Scissors 🪨📄✂️

## Overview
This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python**.  
The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random choice.  
The program then determines the winner based on the game rules.

This project is created as a **beginner Python exercise** to practice input handling, lists, conditionals, and randomness.

## How the Game Works
1. The player selects:
   - `0` for Rock
   - `1` for Paper
   - `2` for Scissors
2. The computer randomly chooses one of the three options.
3. Both choices are displayed using ASCII art.
4. The program compares the choices and prints:
   - Win
   - Lose
   - Draw

## Concepts Used
- `input()` for user input
- `int()` for type conversion
- Lists (`[]`)
- `if / elif / else` statements
- `random.randint()`
- Basic input validation
- ASCII art printing
